Zappos
======
This program is for my Zappos software development internship application.  I went with binary search algorithms within each "facet bucket" and cached the results for speedier searching.

Additionally, I went with json-smart because it had the best benchmarks that I could find. I've been using mostly C/C++ lately and thought that I should brush up on my Java a bit.
